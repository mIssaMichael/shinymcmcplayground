<p>The algorithm requires a proposal distribution <span class="math inline">q(\boldsymbol{\theta}' \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})</span> that suggests new states. In our implementation, we use a multivariate Gaussian random walk proposal:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{\theta}' &\sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) \
\end{aligned}
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}</span> is the covariance matrix that determines the scale and correlation structure of the proposed moves. This is a symmetric proposal distribution, meaning <span class="math inline">q(\boldsymbol{\theta}' \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) = q(\boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}')</span>, which simplifies the acceptance probability calculation.</p>
<p>Other common choices for proposal distributions include:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
\text{Independent:} \quad \boldsymbol{\theta}' &\sim q(\boldsymbol{\theta}') \\\\
\text{Component-wise:} \quad \theta_i' &\sim q(\theta_i' \mid \theta_i)
\end{aligned}
</span></p>
<p>The choice of proposal distribution affects the efficiency of the algorithm but not its correctness, as long as it satisfies basic regularity conditions. For the multivariate Gaussian case, the efficiency is particularly sensitive to the choice of <span class="math inline">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}</span>, which should be tuned to match the scale and correlation structure of the target distribution.</p>
