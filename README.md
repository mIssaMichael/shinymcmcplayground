# SHINY MCMC PLAYGROUND
This is an interactive Shiny app built on top of tomicapretto/shiny-hmc project. It's still in early stages but I'm hoping to clean some of the features up and then add a few other MCMC samplers to play with. Check out the original on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomicapretto/shiny-hmc)
